# Dynotree Py Docs

Small repository to generate and deploy the Python documentation of Dynotree.

The documentation is generated and deployed [here](https://quimortiz.github.io/dynotree_pydoc/index.html) automatically using GitHub actions.

Sphinx documents the Python module from PyPI.

The documentation is minimal. The goal is to provide an index or overview of all the available classes.

Check the examples and tests in the main repository to learn how to use the code.

Note that the main repository is hosting the documentation for the C++ library.
